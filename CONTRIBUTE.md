### How we use Gitflow
How we use [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) and how you can contribute following a few steps.

- The main branch is what is released and developed currently.
- You can create a feature-branch that is named: feature/YOUR-FEATURE-NAME.
- Your feature branch always has the main branch as a starting point.
- When you are done with your feature you should create a pull request into the main branch.
- The main branch is protected.

### Tagging your commit

Always add a reference to your issue to your git commit.

For example: `gh-100: This is the commit message`

AKA: smart commits

### Pull Request

If you create a pull request without smart commits, the pull request will be [squashed into](https://blog.github.com/2016-04-01-squash-your-commits/) one git commit.
